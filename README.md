# Classfied Banners

This is a plugin for the [ajaxeplorer](http://ajaxexplorer.info) web-based file browser that places a banner at the top and bottom of the site indicating the site's level of classification.

### There are three levels of site-classification available:
1. Unclassified (Displays a green banner at the top and bottom of the site.)
2. Classified (Displays a yellow banner at the top and bottom of the site.)
3. Top-Secret (Displays a red banner at the top and bottom of the site.)

## Usage and Installation

1. Copy this repository to your /plugins directory.
2. Navigate to _Settings_ using the left-hand dropdown menu.
3. Locate the *Gui* plugins in the left-hand column.
4. Double-click the _Classified_ plugin and enable it.
5. Select your site classification level from the select box.
6. In order to see the plugin activated, you will need to clear AjaxExplorer's cache.
